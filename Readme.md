## What's the point

## Configuration

## What's in this project

I know you can just look through the `package.json` file to see what the top level dependencies for this project are, but to help make this more accessible for people who may be new to node development (similar to myself at the moment), I'd like to point out that the only top level dependencies for this project are:

- [Twitter sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter)
- [pngjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pngjs)
- [Node Notifier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-notifier)
- [Chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk)

That's it. You can totally dive in and understand this!

And really some of these dependencies are not even necessary, they're just nice to have (i.e. desktop notifications (node-notifier) and colored output for the command line (chalk)). 

Dig a bit. If you have questions ping [me on twitter](https://twitter.com/cschmitz81) and I'll try to help you out.

## Things it still needs

- Linux support
- Windows support
